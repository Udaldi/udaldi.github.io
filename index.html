									How are you doing?
								</p>
								<p>
									Very busy but fine, thank you! <br />Busy doing what I like, so I am lucky.
								</p>
								<p class="red_text">
									You've been busy working on this website, while other crows have been training for their triple somersault and pirouettes.
								</p>
								<p>
									Yes... But finally I made it! <br />
									I've been a website programmer since October 2016. I made websites for others since then and now I thought it's time to make my own.
								</p>
								<p class="red_text">
									Was it different making yours from making for others?
								</p>
								<p>
									When it is for a client, there is a process of knowing him well before I get started.<br /> 
									Apart from the technical and functional requirements, I need to know the person who the website is going to represent.<br />
									The design should express his essence, just like a portrait... At least, that is what I try.
								</p>
								<p class="red_text">
									Portrait website?
								</p>
								<p>
									After I worked with different clients, I started to notice the expressive power of the website. <br />
									A website can contain a very private world in itself and that makes it a powerful tool to describe the inner world of its owner. 
									I want to make unique websites describing the uniqueness of their owners and what make them so special.<br />
									And that's an inner portrait of him, indeed.<br />
									What I'm discovering about websites is just the tip of the iceberg... The more I explore, the more posibilities I find. <br />
								</p>

							<div class="flex_item_margin interview">
								<p class="red_text">
									These days, you can find fair good variety of website templates.<br />
									People don't need website designers anymore. What do you think?
								</p>
								<p>
									Well, that's true in many cases. Now everyone can make his own website with professional look without coding at all.
									Setting in the template images and texts of yours, it turns into a somewhat unique website. Templates are marvelous tool in their way...<br /><br />
									Template represents what industrial revolution brought to this world.
									The mass production, the lower cost... sacrificing the very meaning of uniqueness and originality.<br />
									To fit in the taste of the majority, many things became neutral and tasteless somehow.<br /><br />
									
									But there are places for everyone. In the same way many people buy their clothes in stores,
									other people need the designers and tailors to make them their unique dress because any prêt-à-porter is what they want.<br />
									To create something really yours, it must be original. Not a copy of thousand copies.<br />
									So templates and website designers are both welcome. We fulfill different needs. 
									We are not mutually explusive, but mutually complementary in this world. <br /><br />
								</p>
								<p class="red_text">
									Ok! Now let's imagine I want a website made by a website designer.<br/> 
									Why should I choose you?
								</p>
								<p>
									Hahaha! <br />
									You simply choose the designer you like. Maybe my taste doesn't fit to yours or maybe it does. I don't know.<br /><br />
									I value the uniqueness and individuality of each person, and that means that I appreciate both, acceptance and rejection.
									As stronge as my personality and my taste can be, it's very natural that people can love it or hate it. <br />
									It's not my concern to be liked by others. I do the work I like.<br /><br />

							<div class="flex_item_margin interview">
								<p>
									If you ask to different painters to make you a portrait, each result will be different, even when you are the same person.
									Because each of us see things differently, give substance to different virtues... and portraits represent more of what the artist see in you, than your own idea of yourself.
									I think you need to know well the artist who is going to make that website that represent you. 
									
								</p>
								<p class="red_text">
									Hmmm... I need to know you better then. How would you seduce me?
								</p>
								<p>
									Haha! Is that the way to know the people deeply?<br /> 
									Well, as a good crow, I'd invite you to fly synchronized together in the nature and then take you to the best waste bin of the city for a romantic dinner. <br />
									How about that?
								</p>
								<p class="red_text">
									... Next question!

						<div class="flex_item" id="item5">
							<div class="flex_item_margin interview">
								<p class="red_text">
									Tell me about the illustrations and photography.
								</p>
								<p>
									I've been a graphic novelist since I was a kid. I always drew in my life. Experimented different materials for different expression... It is unbelievable that drawing can give people emotions, isn't it? <br />
									Sometimes we take this for granted and we simply forget about it, but it's really amazing, almost a magic. <br />As a child, I saw the graphic novel as my way to tell stories. Still I think it's amazing that only pen and papers can do so much!!
